# GraphTheory

Welcome to the GraphTheory repository! This repository contains a set of algorithms developed for the course of Graph Theory, which was lectured by Rian Gabriel Pinheiro at UFAL. The algorithms included in this repository are Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, and Bellman-Ford algorithm.

## Brief

Graph Theory is a fundamental field in computer science and mathematics that studies the relationships between objects. This repository serves as a resource for students and enthusiasts interested in graph algorithms and their implementations.

## Algorithms

This repository includes the following algorithms:

1. **Prim's Algorithm**: A greedy algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph.
2. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Another greedy algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree, but it works on connected, undirected graphs as well.
3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: A popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted, directed graph.
4. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: A versatile algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source to all other vertices, even in graphs with negative weight edges.
